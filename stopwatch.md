# Problem Solving - building a stopwatch

So far, we've been spending a lot of time and energy learning the fundamentals.
This is important, but so far it's not so much use in the real world. It's like
knowing what bricks, windows and doors do, but not being able to build a house.

One way to think about computer programming is that it's the art of solving
problems with a computer. And there are all sorts of problems and all sorts of
ways of solving them. So it's not enough just to learn how to build a particular
house and remember that solution. We also need to practice problem solving itself.

What we're going to do is look at solving a real problem in the context of your
classroom. We're going to build something that's useful: a stopwatch.

# Preparation

It's great if you have some time to try solving this yourself first.
Have a think about:

* What does a stop watch do?
* What are the fundamental parts?
* How could you most clearly and simply describe everything a stopwatch does?

Einstein said if he had only one hour to save the world he'd spend fifty-five
minutes defining the problem and only five minutes finding the solution.

We tend to rush into the solutions without properly defining what the problem
really is. So let's have a longer look at what the stopwatch 'problem' really is:

* It counts up in one second intervals
* It has a method to start counting
* It has a method to stop counting
* It has a method to reset the counter

There is no 'correct' way of solving each of these challenges, which is one
reason why it's hard doing this. You need to be prepared for there to be lots of
correct answers! Remember all the different ways we solved [taking the
register](bubblesort.md)?

If you get stuck or want inspiration, have a look at the some of the
[solutions](stopwatch_resources.md) here. Some use numbers, some use rotating
hands, some use variables, some use broadcasts.

## Discussion

* Ask your children what a stop watch is, and when you'd use one. 
* Ask them to think about how they'd make a stopwatch - give them some time and
then talk through the results.
* Explain that one of the hard parts of problem solving is to know what the
problem is - so define all the important parts together (see above).

## Method

* Get them working in pairs to draw a picture of what their scratch programs
might look like. Use this time to talk to the children about their solutions.
* Once you're happy that they have enough on paper to be attempting a solution
in scratch, let them move to a computer and try their ideas.
