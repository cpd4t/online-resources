# Problem Solving - building a stopwatch

So far, we've been spending a lot of time and energy learning the fundamentals.
This is important, but so far it's not much use in the real world. It's like
knowing what bricks, windows and doors do, but not being able to build a house.

Computer programming is really the art of solving problems with a computer. And
there are all sorts of problems and all sorts of ways of solving them, so it's
not enough just to learn how to build a particular house - we also need to
practice problem solving itself.

What we're going to do is build something that could be useful in your
classroom, a stopwatch.
