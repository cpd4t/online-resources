# Waveform!

Waveform is a computer science project that aims to make programming more 'real' by using computer programs to make physical objects. 

This project was inspired by the [waveform necklace](http://www.instructables.com/id/Waveform-Necklace-Bracelet/).

We'll be making a necklace or a keyring like this:

From an audio recording like this:

Each student can record their own phrase or sound, and then turn it into a physical object.

# Prerequisites

* A laser cutter at your school and a good relationship with the DT department! The beads take about 5 minutes per student to cut. Ask them if they can try to cut the [circles.eps](circles.eps) file. This is the format we'll be providing. Ask for a sample of the material and find out its thickness. They may need to change the line width of the lines.
* Basic Python programming experience. Use our [Turtle Prize](turtleprize.md) lesson plans to get started if necessary.
* Printer, paper for printing the patterns on.
* Needles, strong thread, necklace/keyring joining bits.

# What we'll cover

* syntax errors,
* file IO,
* Turtle library,
* basic maths related to circles,
* functions,
* problem solving.
