# Algorithms - the bubble sort

Computer programming is the art of solving problems with a computer.

Because computers don't have intelligence, we have to tell them exactly what we need them to do, using a computer program. The computer follows each step in the program until the program is finished.

We could solve a problem in many different creative ways, and each of those ways we call an algorithm.

For example, you probably take the register in class by calling each child's name in turn and looking for them or listening to them respond. Your algorithm probably goes like this:

* Call out first name in the list,
* Wait for response,
* Tick or cross a box next to the name,
* Repeat until the list if finished.

Another algorithm would be to ask each child to tick their own name when they come in.

* Find my name on the board,
* Tick it.

And how about something completely different:

* Tell each child to write their name on a piece of paper and hold it up,
* Take a photo and save it on a USB stick.

Each method takes the register, but they all have advantages and disadvantges.  The first, traditional way is reliable but slow. The second way is unreliable but fast. The 3rd way is fast, lets you process the register later, but you don't have a paper record. 

# The bubble sort

A good example of a set of real computing algorithms is sorting numbers. For example when you save someone's name in your phone book, they'll appear in alphabetical order. On your phone, a sorting algorithm makes sure everything is in the right place.

The bubble sort is a simple type of sorting algorithm that helps to satisify the KS1&2 requirements for understanding and describing a simple algorithm.

## Preparation

Large numbers drawn on paper. They can be random numbers between 1 and 20. They don't need to be in sequence. The children can do this themselves. You could ask the children to work out what week their birthday falls in and use that if you wanted to sort by age.

## Discussion

* Ask the children how they could sort the numbers into numerical order, 
* Get them to break down each step into very simple instructions, 

## Method

And now you can teach them how the bubble sort works.

Use about 15 people maximum, as it can take a long time to do the sort. In a class of 30 it's good to have an audience, with half the class doing the sort and the others watching.

* Get the children holding the numbers to run about until you shout stop. Then they get in a line - which should be a random order.
* We start from left to right, moving up 1 pair at a time. The right hand child of the first pair will be the left hand child of the next pair.
* The first pair of children step forward and look at each others number, if the left number is smaller they stay where they are, otherwise they swap places.
* The children step back and the next pair is formed. Repeat till the end of the line.
* Keep repeating from left to right until no children swap places.

The higher numbers have bubbled up to the top!
