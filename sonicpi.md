# Programming music with Sonic Pi

We've already seen some creative programming with the [Turtle
Prize](turtleprize.md). Now lets take a look at using programming to create
music. Sonic Pi is based on Ruby, a language quite like Python - it's text based
so we'll have the same challenges related to learning the codes and [syntax
errors](sabotage.md).

Sonic Pi is currently (as of 10/2014) only available for the Raspberry Pi and Mac OSX.
We're assuming you're using a Pi.

# Preparation

## Install

Log into the Pi and start a terminal. Then run

    sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install sonic-pi
    check this TODO

You'll be asked a question about letting the program run with realtime
privileges, to which you should choose 'yes'.

## Check your headphones

We use headphone splitters, and ask students to work in pairs. A headphone
splitter will make the music a bit quieter so it's worth checking things are
working before you use them.

You can turn up the volume a bit with the preferences button.

You should also be aware that you can easily make sounds that are too low to
hear over headhpones. We've found the suggested `play 50` is often too low for
the cheaper over the ear style headphones.

## Resources

One of the great things about Sonic Pi is that it comes with a scheme of work
comprising 6 lesson plans and handouts. You can [download them all from the
website](TODO).

There's also a [competition your students can enter here](TODO)
