# Aerial photography with a raspberry pi and scratch

When we think about computers, we're often imagining laptops or
desktops, with keyboards, mice and screen. While it's true that these
types of computers are the ones we're mostly likely to develop
programs with - it's good to remember that we can take our programming
skills and apply them to much smaller, portable computers that might
run on batteries.

A great example of using a small computer is for aerial photography.
There are, as always lots of ways of doing this. You should check out
[Dave Akerman's](link here) work and pictures using the Raspberry Pi.

One problem with this type of fully fledged aerial photography is the
cost, complexity and time required are often too high for a school to
consider. We'll solve these issues by doing tethered aerial
photography - holding the balloon down with a long string.

In this 2 hour workshop, we'll:

* Look at sequences with the [robot game](robot.md),
* Write a program in scratch to take photos,
* Fly the balloon and take photos,
* Admire the photos!

Optionally you can tie in some maths with calculations on the amount
of helium needed and the size of balloon that requires.

# Kit list

As well as a Raspberry Pi, this workshop needs some extra equipment:

* Raspberry Pi Camera board,
* USB battery pack,
* large balloons,
* a large party balloon helium canister,
* string.

You can buy a complete kit of parts from our partners at [piffin](TODO).

# Warning!

It's worth noting that the same risks as flying a kite apply.
Most importantly, you must check that the flight area has no overhead power lines.
