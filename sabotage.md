# Defeating Syntax errors with Sabotage

One of the challenges involved in learning a text based language like
[Python](turtleprize.md) or [Ruby](sonicpi.md) is that we have to learn all the
codes we use, and to then spell them correctly. We also need to ensure we get
the symbols and punctuation in the right places, and in the case of Python; make
sure our indentation is correct. Any problems with any of these will result in a
syntax error.

As a teacher, you want to be helping your students with learning the codes,
problem solving, debugging and creating. The last thing you want is to be
constantly rushing around spotting typos and punctuation mistakes!

Sabotage was invented by [Alan O'Donohoe](http://twitter.com/teknoteacher) to
teach resilience in dealing with these types of errors.

## Method

Get your students to work in pairs for this game.

Each pair loads their most recent program and saves it to a new file called
'sabotaged.py' using `file->save as`.

The first step is for each student to show the other that their program works
and that it doesn't have any errors.

They then privately make 5 deliberate syntax errors. Students will already have come
across syntax errors as they are easily caused by:

* missing a : at the end of a line,
* not indenting properly after a `while` loop,
* getting case wrong - Python is case sensitive,
* not matching ( and ) brackets,
* spelling.

After making 5 errors, the pairs swap places.

To start with, make sure that the pairs work together on first one program and then the next.
So the student going first will try and fix the syntax errors in their partners
program, and it they get stuck the author can give them clues.

This game is really good fun and worth using a few times until your students are
really quick at spotting and fixing errors.

If your students are working in pairs already, then you can have them both
create the errors, then one student in a pair will swap places with a student
from another pair.
