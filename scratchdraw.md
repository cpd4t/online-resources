# Draw your initial with Scratch

A nice introduction to Scratch is using the pen tools. These let you draw like
you can in Logo, Turtle or Beebots.


## Preparation

Make sure scratch is working on the computers you plan to use. This activity can
be done with Scratch 1 or 2. Screenshots will be shown from Scratch 2.

It's nice to first re-visit the [Robot Game](robot.md) as this puts your young
programmers in the mind of having to navigate looking down on the robot. If you
play the robot game, then draw attention to the need for the robot to always
start in the same place, and with the same direction.

Get paper and pens ready.

## Method

### Solving the problem on paper

Ask the children to first draw their initial on a piece of paper. If they have
curves in their initial, ask them to simplify it by using straight lines.

Ask them to choose a starting point, and to mark it with a circle.

Ask them to consider each of the straight lines that a robot would have to move
to draw their initial if it had a pen sticking out of it.

Ask if they'd need any new commands from the robot game. For example, if their initial has multiple lines, like a T, either they can go back the way
they came, or they might want to create a `pen up` and `pen down` command.

Ask them to write out the codes they'd need to draw their initial just as they'd
done for the robot game.

### Moving to Scratch

Starting point: build & test
Scratch equiv blocks: build bit by bit, incrementally testing
Differentiation: looping and colours
