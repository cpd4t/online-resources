# Turtle Prize - learn Python basics by getting creative

Python can be a big step for students used to a graphical programming language
like scratch. They'll need to get used to a less graphical programming
environment, learn and remember new codes, and fix typos and syntax errors.

We can make the tranisition easier by doing something a bit familiar and a bit
fun. We'll recap some of the fundamentals and then get started with using
Python's turtle library to create some simple computer graphics.

1. The first lesson will be about learning some of the basics of computer programming, and learning how to draw the initial of your name with computer codes.

2. The second lesson will be spent looking at loops and variables.

3. The final lesson will look at conditionals and get a bit more in depth with the
turtle library. 

Students can enter their creations onto the Turtle Prize website. The winning
entry will be judged on originality and how good it looks. The winner across all
entrants and schools will win a Raspberry Pi and an electronics experimenter's
kit.
