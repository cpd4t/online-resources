# Events - Soundbox

One thing causing another thing to happen. Often in computing we want to wait for something to happen, then we do something in response.

## Discussion

Ask for examples of when computers have to wait for something to happen. MP3 players, phones and cars contain computers that are waiting for us to do something. But they are also doing something ‘in the background’. For example an MP3 player is playing the music without us having to keep telling it to.

## Preparation

* Get a well known song and split it up into sections - 1 less than number of children in each group.
* About 8 per group is a good number.

## Method

Children write down each section on a piece of paper.

* The children get in a random order around a central conductor - who triggers the phrase by touching shoulders.
* The conductor has to work out which order to touch shoulders to make the song come out right.

## Variations

* children come up with their own sound/movement to make when someone touches their shoulder.
* variation: ask conductor to touch multiple shoulders at once - illustrates parallelism.
