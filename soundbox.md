# Events - Soundbox

Let's take the example of a computer game. We can use a [sequence of instructions](robot.md) to program a baddy to move about. But how do we get the program to move the hero about when we press a key? And how could we program the computer to know when the hero zaps the baddy?

These are both examples of when we would use events. When we can't predict when something will happen but we want to respond to it, we use events.

# Soundbox

## Discussion

Ask for examples of when computers have to wait for something to happen. MP3 players, phones and cars contain computers that are waiting for us to do something. But they are also doing something 'in the background'. For example an MP3 player is playing the music without us having to keep telling it to.

## Preparation

* About 8 per group is a good number.
* Use a well known song or rhyme and split it up into sections - 1 less than number of children in each group. You can [download some example sheets here](soundbox_rhymes.md)
* Children write down each section on a piece of paper and memorise it.

## Method

* The children get in a random order around a central conductor - who triggers the phrase by touching shoulders.
* The conductor has to work out which order to touch shoulders to make the song come out right.

## Variations

* Children come up with their own sound/movement to make when someone touches their shoulder.
* Ask conductor to touch multiple shoulders at once, this is fun and a nice illustration of parallelism.
